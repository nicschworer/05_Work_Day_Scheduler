# 05_Word_Day_Scheduler

LINK to deployed app: 

The assignment here was to create a calendar page that takes in notes/todos for typical work hours and saves them to local storage for future reference, even after the browser is closed or the page is refreshed. This means taking the user input, referencing the hour block in which it was input, and saving to local storage in such a way that it can be pulled back into your calendar when it is reloaded. I also added a clear button at the bottom which clears the entirety of the local storage for when you're starting a new day. 

Here is a snapshot of the app:
